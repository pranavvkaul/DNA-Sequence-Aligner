# DNA SEQUENCE ALIGNER
DNA sequence alignment is a fundamental problem in bioinformatics, where the goal is to identify similarities and differences between two DNA sequences. Dynamic programming provides an efficient solution to this problem by allowing us to compute the optimal alignment score and the corresponding alignment itself.
This repository contains implementations of dynamic programming algorithms to achieve optimal local and global alignments for given DNA sequences.

# Global Alignment
Global alignment aims to align the entire length of two sequences, from start to end. It considers the entire length of both sequences, even if they are dissimilar in some regions. The objective is to find the best overall alignment that maximizes the similarity between the sequences. The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm is a classic example of a global alignment algorithm, often used for comparing biological sequences.

# Local Alignment
Local alignment, on the other hand, focuses on identifying regions of similarity between two sequences. It does not require aligning the entire length of both sequences; instead, it seeks to find segments (subsequences) within the sequences that are most similar. Local alignment is useful for identifying functional or structural domains within sequences, even if the overall sequences are dissimilar. The Smith-Waterman algorithm is a well-known local alignment algorithm, commonly used in bioinformatics for comparing protein or DNA sequences.
